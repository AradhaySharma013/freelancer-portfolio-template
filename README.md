## How to Set It Up
1. **Get the Files**:
   - Download and unzip the folder.
   - You’ll see `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and images (like `project1.jpg`).

2. **Make It Yours**:
   - **Text**: Open `index.html` in Notepad (or free VS Code). Change "Welcome to My Portfolio" or "Project One" to your own words.
   - **Photos**: Replace `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, etc., with your own. Keep the same file names, or update them in `index.html`.
   - **Colors**: In `styles.css`, change `--primary-color: #007bff` (blue) to another color (e.g., `#ff0000` for red). Try coolors.co for color ideas.
   - **Logo**: Swap `favicon.png` with your own small logo or icon.

3. **Set Up the Contact Form**:
   - Sign up for free at [[formspree.io][(https://formspree.io/f/xzzjvvby).
   - Get your form ID (like `xyourformid`).
   - In `index.html`, replace `your-form-id` in `<form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id">` with your ID.
   - Now, form messages go to your email.

4. **Put It Online**:
   - Use a free hosting site:
     - **Netlify**: Drag your folder to netlify.com > Sites > Add new site.
     - **GitHub Pages**: Upload to a GitHub repo and turn on Pages (see [GitHub’s guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)).
   - You’ll get a free URL like `yourname.netlify.app`.

5. **Check It Works**:
   - Visit your site’s URL.
   - Click the navigation, test the form, and view it on your phone to make sure it looks great.

## Extra Tips
- **Add More Projects**: In `index.html`, copy a `<div class="project-card">` section to add more projects.
- **Change Fonts**: Want a cool font? Add a free Google Fonts link in `index.html`’s `<head>` (find at fonts.google.com).
- **Need Ideas?**: Check free image sites like Unsplash.com for photos.
