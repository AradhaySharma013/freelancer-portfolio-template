## How to Customize
1. **Replace Images**: Swap `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, `project3.jpg` in the `projects` folder with your own images.
2. **Update Text**: Edit content in `index.html` (e.g., hero section, project descriptions).
3. **Change Colors**: Modify `--primary-color` and `--secondary-color` in `styles.css`.
4. **Form Setup**: Replace `your-form-id` in the form's `action` attribute with your Formspree ID.

## Setup
1. Host on any static hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
2. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, images) are in the same directory.
3. Test responsiveness using browser dev tools.
